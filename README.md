### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a controlling dashboard using HTML, CSS and Javascript (React).

### Brief

You are a member of the Alasco engineering team and you just finished a call with a customer. You talked about how the customer doesn't have an overview about current costs of a construction project. This slows down their work considerably and you want to provide a solution for this problem. You quickly scribble down some notes and after a few hours of relentless work you have a design in mind.

### Tasks

* Implement the assignment using:
  * Language: **Javascript** (optional: Typescript)
  * Framework: **React**
* Build out the project to the designs inside the `/wireframes` folder
* Connect your application to the controlling API at https://dl5mns5bwg.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod (_Note: Adding new items is only done in the client for prototyping reasons by now_)
* Implementation details:
  * parse the API response and display the results
  * add a form which makes it possible to add new items including an automatic calculation of the gross amount (feel free to use the currency you want)
  * build a overview box which represents the current state in the client
  * add a possibility for starring and deleting items
  * add a toggle button to just display the starred items

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository. To make reviewing easier, include a fully built version (= running version to view in a browser) of your assignment in a folder named **public**.

### Evaluation Criteria

* **Javascript (optional: Typescript)** best practices
* We value good design / UI as much as clean code. Please consider this in your implementation
* We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
* Show us your work through your commit history
* Completeness: did you complete the features?
* Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
* Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
* Feel free to add additional libraries to implement the feature
* The wireframes are just there to get a first impression of the solution, feel free to change stuff when you think it's necessary
* It would be good to see at least one unit (or) integration test in your solution

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,

The Alasco Team
